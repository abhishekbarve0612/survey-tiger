## Available Links/Pages/Paths

#### Landing Page: "/"

#### Create Survey Page: "/create-survey/"

### Major Functionalities

Used Context API to maintain different survey question data <br>
Used Bootstrap to make it responsive <br>
We can create survey and submit survey <br>
It keeps the survey questions stored until page does not refresh<br>
As it only stores the data in context

### More To Be Done

I will include how I can maintain the different surveys using APIs or DB<br>
I will also includethe feature of saving the survey result and representing it graphically

### npm i or yarn add after cloning the repo to see
